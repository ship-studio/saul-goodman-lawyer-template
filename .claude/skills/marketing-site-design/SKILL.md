# Marketing Site Design Skill

This skill provides proven patterns for structuring marketing pages that convert visitors into customers.

## Homepage Section Architecture

The most effective homepage follows this flow (adapt based on SITE.md goals):

### Standard Flow (Recommended Order)

1. **Hero** — Hook with outcome, primary CTA
2. **Social Proof Bar** — Logos, numbers, or testimonial snippet
3. **Problem/Pain** — Acknowledge their struggle
4. **Solution/Features** — How you solve it
5. **How It Works** — Simple 3-step process
6. **Benefits** — What they gain (not what you do)
7. **Testimonials** — Full social proof section
8. **Pricing** — (if applicable)
9. **FAQ** — Overcome objections
10. **Final CTA** — Last chance conversion

### Section Purposes

| Section | Goal | Visitor Mindset |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Hero | Stop scroll, promise outcome | "What is this?" |
| Social Proof Bar | Build instant credibility | "Is this legit?" |
| Problem | Show you understand them | "Do they get me?" |
| Features | Explain capabilities | "What does it do?" |
| How It Works | Remove complexity fear | "Is it hard?" |
| Benefits | Paint the after-state | "What's in it for me?" |
| Testimonials | Prove others succeeded | "Has it worked for others?" |
| Pricing | Enable decision | "Can I afford it?" |
| FAQ | Remove final doubts | "But what about...?" |
| Final CTA | Convert the convinced | "I'm ready" |

## Hero Section Patterns

### Pattern 1: Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS)

Best for: Pain-point-driven products

```
[Headline: State the problem]
Tired of losing customers to slow support?

[Subheadline: Agitate + solve]
Every hour you take to respond, 60% of leads go cold.
Our AI responds in seconds—24/7.

[CTA]
Start responding faster →
```

### Pattern 2: Outcome-Focused

Best for: Aspirational products/services

```
[Headline: Promise the end state]
Wake up to a full calendar

[Subheadline: How you deliver it]
Automated booking that fills your schedule while you sleep.

[CTA]
See how it works →
```

### Pattern 3: Social Proof Lead

Best for: Established brands with strong numbers

```
[Headline: Lead with proof]
Join 12,847 marketers who doubled their open rates

[Subheadline: Explain the mechanism]
AI-powered subject lines that your audience actually clicks.

[CTA]
Write better emails →
```

### Pattern 4: Direct Benefit

Best for: Clear, simple products

```
[Headline: Straight to the benefit]
Ship 10x faster

[Subheadline: Brief explanation]
The React component library built for speed.

[CTA]
Browse components →
```

### Pattern 5: Question Hook

Best for: Audiences aware of problem but not solution

```
[Headline: Ask their burning question]
What if your website actually brought in leads?

[Subheadline: Promise the transformation]
Stop being a digital brochure. Start being a sales machine.

[CTA]
Transform my site →
```

## Layout Principles

### The F-Pattern

For text-heavy pages (blogs, docs):
- Eye scans horizontally across top
- Then moves down left side
- Then scans horizontally again

**Implementation:**
- Most important content in top-left
- Key info at start of each section
- Visual breaks to create new scan points

### The Z-Pattern

For conversion-focused pages (landing pages):
- Eye moves: top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right
- CTA should be at final Z destination

**Implementation:**
- Logo top-left
- Navigation/secondary CTA top-right
- Supporting content bottom-left
- Primary CTA bottom-right

### Visual Hierarchy Rules

1. **Size = Importance**: Largest = most important
2. **Contrast = Attention**: High contrast draws eye
3. **Spacing = Grouping**: Close things feel related
4. **Alignment = Order**: Aligned things feel intentional

### Breaking the Grid (Tastefully)

Ways to add visual interest without chaos:
- One oversized element per section
- Asymmetric two-column layouts (60/40, 70/30)
- Overlapping elements (image over background)
- Offset headings (not always centered)
- Mixed alignment across sections

## Section Design Patterns

### Social Proof Bar

```
[Logo] [Logo] [Logo] [Logo] [Logo]
"Trusted by 10,000+ companies"
```

Or with metrics:
```
12M+          4.9★           99.9%
Users         Rating         Uptime
```

### Features Section (NOT 3-column grid)

**Option A: Alternating Image/Text**
```
[Image]     [Text Block]
[Text Block]     [Image]
[Image]     [Text Block]
```

**Option B: Bento Grid**
```
[Large Feature Card]  [Small]
[Small] [Small]  [Medium]
```

**Option C: Single Feature Focus**
```
[Large Screenshot/Demo]
[3 bullet points below]
```

### How It Works Section

Always 3 steps (cognitive sweet spot):
```
1. Sign Up        2. Connect        3. Grow
Create account    Link your tools   Watch results
in 30 seconds     with one click    roll in
```

Use numbered circles or icons, horizontal layout.

### Testimonials Section

**Option A: Featured Quote**
```
"[Impactful quote]"
— Name, Title at Company
[Photo]
```

**Option B: Grid of Cards**
```
[Quote + Photo]  [Quote + Photo]
[Quote + Photo]  [Quote + Photo]
```

**Option C: Carousel (use sparingly)**
Only if you have 5+ strong testimonials.

### Pricing Section

Always include:
- Clear tier names
- Who each tier is for
- Most popular indicator
- Annual/monthly toggle (if applicable)
- What's included list
- CTA per tier

### FAQ Section

Use accordion/expandable pattern:
- Start all closed or first open
- Group by theme if 8+ questions
- Include actual objection-handling questions

## Conversion Optimization Rules

### Above the Fold
Must include:
- Clear headline (what you do)
- Subheadline (how it benefits them)
- Primary CTA
- Trust signal (logo bar or brief social proof)

### CTA Frequency
- Hero: Primary CTA
- After features: Secondary CTA
- After testimonials: Primary CTA
- Fixed in nav: Always visible CTA

### Reducing Friction
- "No credit card required" under CTA
- "Cancel anytime" near pricing
- "Takes 2 minutes" to set expectations
- Show testimonial near conversion point

### Mobile Considerations
- Hero headline must work in 2 lines max
- CTAs must be thumb-reachable
- Horizontal scrolling elements (logos, testimonials)
- Stack all columns to single column

---

## Page-Specific Guidelines

### About Page
- Lead with mission, not history
- Show real team photos
- Include company timeline (optional)
- End with CTA (hiring or contact)

### Pricing Page
- Lead with value proposition, not prices
- Comparison table for 3+ tiers
- FAQ section below pricing
- Social proof near CTA

### Contact Page
- Simple form (name, email, message)
- Alternative contact methods
- Expected response time
- Map/location (if relevant)
